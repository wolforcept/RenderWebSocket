-My Node.js Server
This is a Node.js server that I have created and am now deploying to Render.com.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your local machine. You can then clone this repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-node-server.git
cd my-node-server
npm install
```
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server by running:

```
npm start
The server should now be running on your local machine.
```
Deploying to Render
To deploy this server to Render, you will need to create a new Render service and push your code to the Render Git repository.

Create a new service on Render by going to the Services page and clicking the "New Service" button.

Choose "Node.js" as the runtime, and select a version of Node.js that is compatible with your code.

Follow the prompts to create a new Git repository for your code.

Add the Render Git repository as a remote for your local repository:

```
git remote add render https://git.render.com/your-username/my-node-server.git
Push your code to the Render Git repository:
Copy code
git push render main
The deployment process will begin, and you can monitor the progress on the Deployments page.
